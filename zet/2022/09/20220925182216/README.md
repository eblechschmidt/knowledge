# Flash Shelly Plug S with ESPHome

## Flashing process
1. Connect iPhone to the WIFI network created by shelly plug
2. Add Shelly device to the iOs app
3. Flash Tasmota OTA by calling http://IP/ota?url=http://dl.dasker.eu/firmware/mg2tasmota-ShellyPlugS.zip
4. Remember: The device creates a new wifi network now. Don't wait for it to be on the existing wifi.
5. Connect to the newly created wifi network and put in wifi credentials when asked for
6. Head to the devices IP address with browser
7. Configure device "Configure -> Configure Other" and paste in the following template: `{"NAME":"Shelly Plug S","GPIO":[56,255,158,255,255,134,0,0,131,17,132,21,255],"FLAG":2,"BASE":45i}`
8. Using another device (one you trust to give right measurements) in series to measure a high load (e.g. a kettle) and write down both values
9. Adapt the measured values in the script and let ESPHome create an image
10. Donwload latest Tasmota minimal image from https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/releases/download/v12.1.1/tasmota-minimal.bin
11. Flash minimal image to have enough space for ESPhome images
12. Now flash the image generated by ESPHome
